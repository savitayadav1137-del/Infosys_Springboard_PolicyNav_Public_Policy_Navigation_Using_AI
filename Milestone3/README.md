## Milestone 3 – Q&A Multi-Language Engine, Summarization, Knowledge Graph & Full Integration
## Description
In this milestone, PolicyNav was extended with an AI-powered Q&A engine, multi-language document summarization, and an interactive knowledge graph — all built on top of the authentication, admin interface, and readability dashboard from Milestone 2. The NLP pipeline uses Qwen 2.5-1.5B-Instruct (4-bit quantized via BitsAndBytes) for generation and NLLB-200 for translation across 8 Indian and international languages. Document retrieval is powered by FAISS with multilingual sentence embeddings. The entire system runs on Google Colab with persistent storage on Google Drive.

## Features Implemented
## Q&A Multi-Language Engine
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline using FAISS vector search + Qwen 2.5-1.5B-Instruct
- Multilingual question input — user can ask in any of 8 supported languages; the question is auto-translated to English for retrieval, then the answer is translated back
- Simplify language toggle that rewrites policy answers in plain, easy-to-understand language
- Source attribution — every answer cites the policy document filenames it was retrieved from, along with response time
- Chat history maintained within the session with styled user/bot message bubbles
- Clear chat button to reset the conversation

## Multi-Language Summarization
- Supports input via pasted text or uploaded files (.txt, .pdf, .docx)
- Adjustable summary length: Short / Medium / Long (80 / 180 / 300 tokens)
- Two-stage pipeline: Qwen generates an English summary → NLLB-200 translates to the target language
- Side-by-side tab display showing both the translated and the original English summary
- Word count comparison between original document and generated summary
- Supports 8 languages: English, Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Marathi, Bengali, Malayalam

## Knowledge Graph
- Upload one or more policy documents (.txt, .pdf) to extract a knowledge graph
- Named entity recognition using spaCy en_core_web_sm — extracts ORG, GPE, LAW, PERSON entities
- Graph built with NetworkX and rendered as a fully interactive HTML visualization using PyVis
- Document nodes (blue) linked to entity nodes (green) — drag, zoom, and explore relationships
- Graph saved to Google Drive under PolicyNav/graphs/ for persistence
- Clear graph button to reset and re-generate

## Vector Store & Document Ingestion
- vector_store.py handles PDF, HTML, and TXT parsing, chunking (1500 chars), and FAISS indexing
- Multilingual embeddings via paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2 (SentenceTransformers)
- Incremental ingestion — already-indexed documents are skipped on re-run for fast startup
- FAISS index and metadata pickled to Google Drive; de-duplication prevents redundant chunks from the same file
- Dedicated PDF downloader cell scrapes and downloads policy PDFs from official government scheme pages

## Full Integration with Milestone 2
- All new features (Chat, Summarize, Knowledge Graph) sit behind JWT-authenticated sessions
- Sidebar navigation dynamically shows the correct menu for User vs Admin roles
- OTP verification, account locking, password history, and forgot password flows fully intact
- Readability Dashboard (Flesch, Kincaid, SMOG, Gunning Fog, Coleman-Liau) remains accessible from the sidebar
- Admin Dashboard (user management, promote, unlock, delete) unchanged and functional

## UI/UX Improvements
- New font pairing: Syne (headings, buttons) + DM Sans (body) replacing the default system fonts
- Full CSS variable system (--bg-deep, --accent-cyan, --accent-violet, etc.) for consistent theming
- Subtle 48px grid texture and a 3px gradient top bar across all pages
- Polished login page with branded card logo and tracked-caps subtitle
- Sidebar user pill badge showing the logged-in email
- Unified .page-header card with a cyan left-border accent across all feature pages
- Styled form panels, input focus rings, progress bar, tabs, expanders, metrics, and custom scrollbar
- Chat bubble animation (msgSlideIn) and page-load fadeUp transitions throughout

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer            | Technology |
|------------------|------------|
| UI Framework     | Streamlit + streamlit-option-menu |
| LLM (Generation) | Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct (4-bit via BitsAndBytes) |
| Translation      | facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M |
| Embeddings       | paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2 (SentenceTransformers) |
| Vector Search    | FAISS (faiss-cpu) |
| NER / Graphs     | spaCy en_core_web_sm + NetworkX + PyVis |
| Authentication   | JWT (PyJWT) + bcrypt + SQLite |
| Storage          | Google Drive (persistent) + SQLite |
| Deployment       | Google Colab + pyngrok |

## How to Run
## 1. Install dependencies
pip install streamlit pyngrok pyjwt watchdog bcrypt PyPDF2 streamlit-option-menu textstat plotly python-docx
pip install sentence-transformers faiss-cpu transformers>=4.40.0 accelerate bitsandbytes spacy networkx pyvis torch langdetect beautifulsoup4
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

## 2. Mount Google Drive and set up directories
Run Cell 2 in the notebook. This creates PolicyNav/, PolicyNav/documents/, and PolicyNav/graphs/ on your Drive and sets the APP_DIR environment variable.

## 3. Download / upload policy PDFs
Run Cell 3 (PDF downloader) to automatically scrape and download policy documents from official government scheme pages into PolicyNav/documents/. You can also manually upload PDFs to that folder.

## 4. Ingest documents into FAISS
Run the Auto-Ingest cell (Cell 9). New PDFs are parsed, chunked, embedded, and added to the FAISS index. Already-indexed files are skipped automatically.


## 5.🔐 Add Colab Secrets

Go to **Colab → Secrets** and add:

| Secret Key         | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY`   | Any strong random string |
| `EMAIL_ID`         | Gmail address for sending OTPs |
| `EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` | Gmail App Password (not your main password) |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL_ID`   | Admin account email |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD`   | Admin account password |
| `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN`  | Your ngrok authentication token |

## 6. Launch the app
Run the Launch cell (Cell 11). This starts Streamlit and exposes it via an ngrok public URL printed in the output.

## Notes
- The Qwen model is loaded in 4-bit quantization using BitsAndBytes to fit within Colab's GPU memory constraints.
- FAISS index and metadata are stored on Google Drive and persist across Colab runtime resets. The users.db and policynav.db databases are also Drive-backed to prevent data loss on disconnection.
- The NLLB-200 translator supports over 200 languages; the app exposes 8 Indian languages in the UI.
- Knowledge graphs are saved as self-contained HTML files to PolicyNav/graphs/ and rendered inline in the Streamlit app via components.html.
- All Milestone 2 security features (OTP, account lock, password history, JWT sessions) are fully preserved and unchanged.
